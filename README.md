# DIYScience

We are working on various projects to network and support grassroots citizen science initiatives

Background
----------
There are a lot of independent communities and initiatives around the world trying to engage with science from a grassroots, non-institutional position: doing our own research, bringing diverse (often marginalised) societal perspectives to the practice or application of science, sharing knowledge, building communities and collaborations. We do this out of personal motivation to learn, to share, to explore our relationship to science, to pursue research and projects that donâ€™t fit within institutional agendas or traditional academic careers. At the core of it is the belief that science should be accessible to and for the benefit of everyone in society, not just the privileged few.

What are we going to work on?
-----------------------------
This project is still very much in development, but there are two main areas we think we could work on:
1. Crowdsource and collect best practice advice and resources from the network on how to successfully run a DIY Science / grassroots citizen science project (on funding, equitable collaboration, how to access space and equipment, etc)
2. Build an advocacy campaign to reach decision-makers that encourages measures to support grassroots citizen science initiatives.

This is an evolving project and precise nature of what we'll be focussing on during the sprint will be defined in the next weeks.
